# Bulletin Board
Is an online bulletin board(similar to facebook). It is my first 'bigger' app using `.NET Blazor Server`. App has many features like
- Bulletins with images, Markdown and Github Emoji
- Bulletin groups with roles
- Report functionality
- Sorting, pagination etc.

## Disclaimer
This app was created long time ago and has A LOT OF mistakes and overall code quality is VERY BAD.
